This is a simple Drum App made in Vannila JS. 

This is part of the JavaScript30 Tutorial. Sound is played when user presses the predefined key on the keyboard. Some additional styling is done to the original project. 

You can check it out working version here: [DEMO](https://antoniomtk.github.io/drum-app/)
